<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; &gt;2: your fixed-width text is *larger* than the default size for fixed-</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; &gt;   width text, and since the default size of my window is 80 fixed-</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; &gt;   width columns wide, I actually lose 2-3 columns off the end of each</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; &gt;   of your lines.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; &gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;&gt; This is really the receivers problem not the senders.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;Total nonsense.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">I do not appreciate your response here!  </FONT></TT><BR/>
<TT>If you continue with this type of response then I will not be </TT><BR/>
<TT>talking to you again.</TT><P>
<TT>If you read the MIME spec (NOT THE HTML spec), then you will see that</TT><BR/>
<TT>display (including line length) is the receiver's problem.  </TT><BR/>
<TT>I am talking about Email not the Web.  Just because HTML is sent in a
</TT><BR/>
<TT>mail message does not change the mail ground rules.</TT><P>
<TT>If the sender choses to write lines longer than 80 columns then the </TT><BR/>
<TT>receiving client should be smart enought to display that text without
loosing anything.</TT><BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
<P>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;By using a "standard" line length but a larger font, you're</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;guarenteeing that anyone with a "standard" sized window will lose,</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;unless they ignore your markup.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT>NO I am not.  Only those people with less than capable clients will</TT><BR/>
<TT>lose.  I am tired of having to deal with broken or less featured</TT><BR/>
<TT>receiving clients.  You could tailor and restrict the HTML you generate</TT><BR/>
<TT>in Mail, but we will let the user have full control.  If he gets in</TT><BR/>
<TT>trouble then its his problem.  The sending user will learn over time.</TT><P>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;I'm not saying that the composer shouldn't be able to control this</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;stuff, I'm just saying that the HTML you sent is ugly.  Those are very</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;different statements.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT>I would think that ugly is a subjective point of view.  You think it is</TT><BR/>
<TT>ugly then fine.  But that is just you and others may not think so.  Plus</TT><BR/>
<TT>its up to the sending user what format he choses.  He could make it look</TT><BR/>
<TT>just fine by your standards.</TT><P>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;tags.  The rest of it is gimickry for its own sake, and it doesn't</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;come free.</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT>I find it very hard to believe that you said this.  There is a bunch</TT><BR/>
<TT>of stuff that can be done in HTML with images in MAIL that cannot be done</TT><BR/>
<TT>in standard MIME.  "It doesn't come free", what in the world are you</TT><BR/>
<TT>talking about.  </TT><P>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">    &gt;But hey, you're welcome to generate ugly HTML in your product.  </FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;I'm sure your users will vote with their feet...</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT>Again this is totally uncalled for.  I have tried to hold a conversation</TT><BR/>
<TT>with you so that mail readers in general can handle HTML in mail.  Since</TT><BR/>
<TT>Netscape has the market share it has I believe that interoperation with</TT><BR/>
<TT>you guys is important.  </TT><P>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;Nobody's telling web page authors that they can't make their pages look</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;any way they like.  But as yourself, when's the last time you saw a web</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;page that looked like your message?  With fixed-width fonts?  With some</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;fonts that were so small as to be unreadable?  That looked really bad</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;if your window wasn't exactly the right size?</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;</FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<B><TT><FONT SIZE="2">&gt;-- </FONT></TT></B><BR/>
<TT>Now this is total nonsense.  Who cares ?  Its all about giving the sending</TT><BR/>
<TT>user all the control he can get.  If he (me in this case) composes "ugly"</TT><BR/>
<TT>HTML then it is his personal business.  Just as long as the sending user</TT><BR/>
<TT>has the tools he needs to construct what he wants.</TT><BR/>
